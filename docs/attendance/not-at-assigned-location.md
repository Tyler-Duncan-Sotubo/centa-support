This article explains why you may see an error saying you are **not at your assigned location** when trying to clock in or clock out in CentaHR.

---

## What this error means

CentaHR automatically verifies your **assigned work location** when you attempt to clock in or clock out.

If your current location does not match your assigned **Office** or **Remote** location, clocking will be blocked and an error message will be shown.

## Common reasons this happens

### You are not at your assigned office location

If you are assigned to an **Office** location, you must be physically present at that location to clock in or out.

Clocking may be blocked if:

- You are outside the allowed office area
- Location verification cannot confirm your presence

Location checks may use GPS, IP address, or a combination of both.

---

### Your Remote assignment has restrictions

Even if you are assigned as **Remote**, your company may still apply:

- Country or region restrictions
- IP address validation
- Device-based rules

If these conditions are not met, clocking will be blocked.

---

### Location access is disabled on your device

If location services are turned off:

- CentaHR cannot verify your location
- Clocking may be blocked automatically

Make sure location access is enabled for your browser or device.

---

### You are using an unsupported network or device

Some companies restrict clocking to:

- Approved office networks (IP-based)
- Specific devices or browsers

Switching to an approved network or device may resolve the issue.

---

## What you can do

1. Confirm you are at your assigned **Office** or approved **Remote** location.
2. Enable **location access** on your device or browser.
3. Refresh the page and try clocking again.
4. If the issue continues, contact your admin.

---

## When to contact your admin

Ask your admin to check:

- Your assigned **work location**
- Attendance location rules
- IP or device restrictions
- Whether clocking is enabled for your role

Admins can update your assignment or correct clocking entries if needed.
