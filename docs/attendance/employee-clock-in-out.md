## Before you start

Make sure that:

- Your account has access to **Attendance**
- Your admin has enabled **time tracking (clocking)**
- You are assigned to a valid **work location** (**Office** or **Remote**)
- If required, you are using an **allowed device or network**

> Work location is **automatically determined** based on your assigned location. You do not need to select it manually.

## How location rules work

Clocking is allowed only if your **assigned work location** matches your actual location.

This may include:

- Office location checks
- Remote work rules
- IP address or device validation (if enabled)

If your location does not match your assignment, clocking may be blocked.

## Fixes and common issues

### I can’t see the Clock in button

- Clocking may not be enabled for your role or company
- You may not be assigned to a valid work location
- Ask your admin to check **Attendance settings** and your **employee profile**

---

### It says I’m already clocked in

- You may have forgotten to clock out earlier
- Refresh the page and check today’s attendance record
- Ask your admin to correct the entry if needed

---

### Clock in/out is blocked

Clocking may be restricted due to:

- Location mismatch
- IP address restrictions
- Device restrictions

If you believe this is incorrect, contact your admin.
